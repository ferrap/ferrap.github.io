I'm a PhD candidate at the [University of Sheffield](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/) <img src="https://emojipedia-us.s3.dualstack.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/thumbs/240/apple/198/flag-for-united-kingdom_1f1ec-1f1e7.png" width="25" height="25" />. My research focuses on the development of optical methods <img src="https://emojipedia-us.s3.dualstack.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/thumbs/320/apple/198/camera_1f4f7.png" width="25" height="25" /> combining image processing and computer vision techniques to characterise the heart muscle deformation and detect the advancement of cardiovascular diseases <img src="https://emojipedia-us.s3.dualstack.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/thumbs/240/apple/198/broken-heart_1f494.png" width="25" height="25" /> .

As [Marie Curie fellow](https://ec.europa.eu/research/mariecurieactions/node_en) <img src="https://emojipedia-us.s3.dualstack.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/thumbs/120/apple/198/flag-for-european-union_1f1ea-1f1fa.png" width="25" height="25" />, I have been a member of a European network made of several universities and biomedical companies ([VPH-CaSE](http://www.vph-case.eu/)).

Before starting my PhD, I obtained both a BSc and MSc (cum laude) in Biomedical Engineering from University Campus Bio-Medico of Rome <img src="https://emojipedia-us.s3.dualstack.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/thumbs/240/apple/198/flag-for-italy_1f1ee-1f1f9.png" width="25" height="25" /> in 2012 and 2015, respectively. During my MSc thesis project, I spent five months as visiting student at Queen Mary University of London. In particular, the thesis covered the development and characterisation of a wearable tactile display made of dielectric elastomers actuator (DEA) for haptic applications in virtual reality systems [See demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnTjN5ySO_E).
