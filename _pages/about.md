I'm a PhD candidate at the [University of Sheffield](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/). My research focuses on the development of optical methods combining image processing and computer vision techniques to characterise the heart muscle deformation and detect the advancement of cardiovascular diseases.

As [Marie Curie fellow](https://ec.europa.eu/research/mariecurieactions/node_en), I have been a member of a European network made of several universities and biomedical companies ([VPH-CaSE](http://www.vph-case.eu/)).
