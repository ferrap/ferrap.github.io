# Who am I?
I am an experienced presale professional in the B2B SaaS industry, with a proven track record of success working with leading companies in the data and analytics space. I have a strong understanding of the intricacies of presales, including managing complex sales cycles and collaborating effectively with a wide range of stakeholders. My experience working across different industries, markets, and geographies has given me a broad perspective and valuable insights into the unique challenges and opportunities facing businesses in various settings. As a skilled communicator, I identify and address client needs, deliver effective solutions, and build strong relationships that drive long-term success. 

# What I've been up to so far

Currently, I'm a Solutions Engineer at [Samsara](https://www.samsara.com/). Previously, I worked in the same role at [Fivetran](https://www.fivetran.com/)and [Tableau Software](https://www.tableau.com/) (a [Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com/) company).

Before embarking on the presales journey, I completed a PhD in Bio-Engineering at the [University of Sheffield](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/). My research focused on the development of optical methods combining image processing and computer vision techniques to characterise heart muscle deformation and detect the advancement of cardiovascular diseases. As [Marie Curie fellow](https://ec.europa.eu/research/mariecurieactions/node_en), I have been a member of a European network made of several universities and biomedical companies ([VPH-CaSE](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/642612)).

Before starting my PhD, I obtained both a BSc and MSc (cum laude) in Biomedical Engineering from University Campus Bio-Medico of Rome in 2012 and 2015, respectively. During my MSc thesis project, I spent five months as visiting student at Queen Mary University of London. In particular, the thesis covered the development and characterisation of a wearable tactile display made of dielectric elastomers actuator (DEA) for haptic applications in virtual reality systems.

In my free time, I love [cooking](https://www.instagram.com/paoloxcook/), listening to podcasts and reading physical books. I'm also fascinated by generative art.
