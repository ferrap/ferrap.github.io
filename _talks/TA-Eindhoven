The Mid-term review for VPH-CaSE took place during the training event. A representative from the European Commission was invited to evaluate the development of the project and formulate recommendations to be followed in the remaining two years of the project. During this review the Supervisory Board and the ESRs had the opportunity to present the achievements and future prospects of the first eighteen months of their individual research projects. The EC representative was impressed with the development and gave the green light for the project to continue!
