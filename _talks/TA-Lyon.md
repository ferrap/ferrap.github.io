The focus of this training activity was to provide the early stage researchers with the abilities they would need to transition from academia into industry. To do so, the ESRs were exposed to the different options they have in industry, from launching their own start-up to working for a multi-national company.

The main training the ESRs received was on how to prepare their CVs, resumes and interviews for jobs in industry. The various activities made throughout the week included CV corrections, research on  companies and mock interviews, all based on real job applications provided by each of the ESRs.
