Abstract:
Three dimensional digital image correlation (3D-DIC) has been investigated to reconstruct the 3D shape and full-field strain of a porcine coronary artery. Methylene blue has been applied for the first time to a coronary artery surface to enhance the contrast of the speckle pattern and reduce reflection issues common with soft tissue and cylindrical geometries. The mean uncertainty of DIC strain measurements
evaluated under rigid body motion (RBM) conditions were less than 0.7%, with a standard deviation ~ 3%. This demonstrates potential of this approach to measure large deformations of arterial tissues at small length scales.
