Abstract:
Three dimensional digital image correlation (3D-DIC) has been employed in vitro to evaluate the strain imposed by a stent on the surface of a porcine artery. The aim of this study was to dynamically evaluate the local strain at the distal end of the stent during the so-called dogboning phase, which may contribute to the degree of in-stent restenosis. A localised region of strain of approximately 30% was observed in this phase, which suggested an asymmetrical balloon unfolding and stent deployment. Future studies will investigate the stent expansion behaviour along the whole stent length and use these experimental findings to validate numerical models of stent-artery interactions.
